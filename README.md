# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (Prompt-Based)

A simple JavaScript guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and a limit they provide.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter a **maximum number**.
2. A random number is generated between `1` and the provided max.
3. The user keeps guessing until:
   - They guess correctly 🎉
   - Or they enter `"Quit"` to exit 😅

The game provides hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" after each guess.

## 🔍 Concepts Practiced

- `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`
- Loops and conditionals
- String/number conversion and comparison
- Basic game logic and user feedback

## 🛠️ How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Open the **Console** (press `F12`).
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter a number as the max limit
   - Try to guess the hidden number
   - Type `"Quit"` anytime to exit
